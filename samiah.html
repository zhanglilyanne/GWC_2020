    <h1>All About Me</h1>
    <div id="Background">
      <p>My name is Samiah Reyes and I am currently a student at Cox Mill High School (10th grade.) I just turned 15, since my birthday was on December 1st! This is also my first year of programming! I decided to join this club to get a better understanding of coding and its purpose outside of regular leisure. Out of school, I like to figure skate! I've been skating for about a year, and continued to do it after moving from New York. Outside of school, I like to play video games with my friends and I'm soon hoping that I can become better at them.</p>

      <h2>What I Want to Learn From Coding</h2>
      <div>
        <p>There are many things that I want to learn from coding. I've been wanting to start a career from it because I like the idea of helping people with their everyday activities. The language that I would like to learn the most is HTML because when I get older, I would like to have a career that has something to do wih webpage design.
