    <p>My name is Serena and I'm currently a seventeen year old senior at my high school. Ever since the end of my freshman year,
      I have had the hobby of playing the guitar. I have performed at open mics and nonprofit events, so I thought that I could 
      share my knowledge with anyone else interested in this instrument. </p>
