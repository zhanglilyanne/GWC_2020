            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Serena and I'm currently a seventeen year old senior at my high school. Ever since the end of my freshman year,
               I have had the hobby of playing the guitar. I have performed at open mics and nonprofit events, so I thought that I could 
               share my knowledge with anyone else interested in this instrument.</p>

      <h2>Getting Started</h2>
      <p>Before you pick up the guitar and start learning, make sure that you and the instrument are ready to play. At the top of
         the guitar, you should see six tuning pegs for making sure the instrument sounds correct. Each of these pegs control the
         tightness, and therefore the pitch, of one of the strings. In order to correctly tune the instrument, you will need a tuner 
         device or a tuning app on your phone. From thickest string to thinnest string, the notes for each should by E-A-D-G-B-E.</p>
      <p>As for getting yourself ready, I would suggest cutting the nails of your fretting hand, or the hand you will use on the
         neck of the guitar to change the sound and chords that the strings create when strumming. This way your fingers will cleanly
         push down the strings. Just as a warning, your fingertips will hurt for the first couple of days. The other hand is used to
         strum the strings over the body of the guitar, which is usually where the hole is for acoustic guitars. Also, make sure you
         have a pick to strum with to project and play out the notes.</p>
      <h2>The Basics</h2>
      <p>You will need to know a few chords, or patterns that your fretting hand makes on the fretboard, in order to start playing
         even the most basic songs. Each of the chords have a root note that the chord is named after, and this tends to be the
         thickest and lowest string that you will strum on the guitar. The best chords for beginners to learn are the A, D, and E
         major chords. Below, I placed the chord charts for the respective chords which will show which fret and string to place
         your fingers for the fretting hand. Once you make these chords on the fretboard, simply strum the strings of the guitar with
         the pick near the sound hole or sound chamber.</p>
