    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <img src="serena_guitar.jpg" width="400.5" height="600"/>
    <p>My name is Serena and I'm currently a seventeen year old senior at my high school. Ever since the end of my freshman year,
      I have had the hobby of playing the guitar. I have performed at open mics and nonprofit events, so I thought that I could 
      share my knowledge with anyone else interested in this instrument. </p>
    <br>
    <h2>Getting Started</h2>
    <p>Before you pick up the guitar and start learning, make sure that you and the instrument are ready to play. At the top of
       the guitar, you should see six tuning pegs for making sure the instrument sounds correct. Each of these pegs control the
       tightness, and therefore the pitch, of one of the strings. In order to correctly tune the instrument, you will need a tuner 
       device or a tuning app on your phone. From thickest string to thinnest string, the notes for each should by E-A-D-G-B-E.</p>
    <p>As for getting yourself ready, I would suggest cutting the nails of your fretting hand, or the hand you will use on the
       neck of the guitar to change the sound and chords that the strings create when strumming. This way your fingers will cleanly
       push down the strings. Just as a warning, your fingertips will hurt for the first couple of days. The other hand is used to
       strum the strings over the body of the guitar, which is usually where the hole is for acoustic guitars. Also, make sure you
       have a pick to strum with to project and play out the notes.</p>
